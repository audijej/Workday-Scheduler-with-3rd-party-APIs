Workday Scheduler and Daily Planner using 3rd part APIs



This daily planner was designed to manage day to day activities by by using a series of time blocks that the user can 
input data and save to the local storage on their device. The data persists throughout the day and will stay on the page
even if the page is refreshed. The time blocks change style class to indicate that the time blocks are either in the past,
present, or future. This possible through using the devices local time and the calendar automatically changes is style class
accordingly.

This project utilizes a basic HTML file with a short JavaScript file embedded within the HTML code. It uses a for loop that creates
unique id's to the input fields and buttons. This allows the users input to be saved as it's own unique parameter. This project also utilizes
a CSS file to give the website it's styling. But most importantly it uses the class styling in accordance with the local time to change the class
to indicate past, present, and future.

The 3rd-party-API used in this project was from moment.js. This allows the project to use a format of time, date and day.

To use this project, simply type in your activities that you have planned throughout the day. Save each event with the "Add Event" button. Refresh to
ensure all of your data persists on your device. As each block of hour goes on throughout the day, check the planner to see your forecasted schedule.
To clear any data, simply delete the text in the input field and click the save button. Refresh the page to ensure the data in cleared. At the end of the day, clear
all the data in the input field and save. The next time you open your browser, you will have a clean template to plan for your next day.

Enjoy and hopefully you can find this daily planner useful.
